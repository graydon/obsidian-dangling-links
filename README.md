![Obsidian Dangling Links demo](assets/overview.gif?raw=true)

This is a small plugin for [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) that displays the set
of dangling links in your current vault in a side-panel -- links you've put in
a note somewhere that don't currently point to anything in the vault.

Dangling links may be typos or they may be links you intended to make a note for
but forgot to get to. Either way, it can be nice to have a list of them to work
with.

## Usage

The panel is accessed with the "Dangling links: Open view" command, or by
clicking the broken-link ribbon icon. Dangling links can be grouped by the
file or folder they occur in, or can be shown as a list of dangling links and
their reference and you can click each occurrence to navigate to it.

You are also able to collapse each item or ignore complete folders from the
settings page.

## Compatibility

I've marked this as requiring obsidian v0.9.15 because that's what I have. If
you get it working on an earlier one, I'm happy to reduce that number. I don't
have a lot of time to spend testing versions though and I don't see a big reason
to stick with old versions.
